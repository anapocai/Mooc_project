More information is available on the <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/new-zealand-safe-travel-zone"">Australian Governments COVID-19 website</a>. <br>
*Testing/Screening on arrival: All travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. <br>
The Australian authorities provide an <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers"">â€˜Information for international travellers fact sheetâ€™</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br>
*Transiting Australia: The<a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br>
Youâ€™re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, youâ€™re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br>
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br>
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australiaâ€™s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on<a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br>
All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. <br>
If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">State and Territory websites</a> for details on quarantine. <br>

If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br>
*Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br>
The Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation. <br>
Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter â€“ see the Department of Home Affairs â€˜Coming to Australiaâ€™ web pages for more information. <br>
Dual Australian/British nationals and permanent residents in Australia are not generally permitted to leave Australia unless they qualify for an exemption. If you meet an exemption category or have a have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should do this as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time. <br>

If youâ€™re a dual national or permanent resident who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia and have spent more time in the last 12 to 24 months outside Australia than within it, you do not need an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport. <br>
If you have not spent more time outside Australia than within it for the last 12 to 24 months, but still consider yourself to be ordinarily resident in another country, you can submit a request for a travel exemption.

*Transiting Cambodia: It is currently not possible to enter or depart Cambodia through land borders as the Cambodia-Laos, Cambodia-Thailand and Cambodia-Vietnam land borders are closed. <br>
*Testing/screening on arrival: All foreigners arriving in Cambodia will now be subject to a COVID-19 test on arrival (as well as requiring a COVID negative test before flying). You will need to remain at a hotel or government facility until the results are known, which may include an overnight stay. <br>
The government is now imposing charges on foreign arrivals for lab testing, medical treatment and accommodation under health measures to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 transmission in Cambodia. <br>
All foreign passengers need to deposit US$2000 for the COVID-19 service charges at the airport upon their arrival. Once deductions for services have been made, the remainder of the deposit will be returned. This can be paid either by cash or credit card. <br>
The service fees are listed as below: <br>

You will be expected to comply with these requirements regardless of any existing medical needs you may have. If youâ€™re not able to submit to these requirements, you should think carefully about whether to travel to Cambodia at this time. <br>

International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry to Canada: The Canadian authorities are barring entry to Canada, including at its border with the US, to most foreign nationals, including British nationals. This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families provided they remain in Canada for 15 days or more. Anyone arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and have a credible self-isolation plan. Immediate and extended family members planning to stay for less than 15 days must be travelling for an essential purpose. Further details are available on the <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-special-measures.html"">Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada website</a> or call the Canada Border Service Agency helpline: 1 800 461 9999. <br>
 The Canadian government requires all passengers aged five and above to test negative for COVID-19 before travelling by air from another country to Canada. Documentation of a negative laboratory test result must be presented to the airline prior to coming to Canada. The test must be performed using a COVID-19 molecular test within 72 hours of boarding a flight to Canada. Passengers without a negative test will be denied boarding. If you are travelling from a country where molecular testing is unavailable you will be required to report to a designated Public Health Agency of Canada quarantine facility for the duration of your mandatory 14-day quarantine. Delays in obtaining test results does not apply. <br>
 Further details are available on <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/transport-canada/news/2020/12/pre-departure-covid-19-testing-and-negative-results-for-air-travellers-coming-to-canada.html"">Transport Canadaâ€™s website</a>.
 From 15 February, travellers arriving by land, with some exceptions, will be required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 molecular test taken in the United States within 72 hours of arrival, or a positive test taken 14 to 90 days prior to arrival. Further details are available on <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health.html"">Public Health Canadaâ€™s website</a>.<br>
At point of departure, air operators must complete a basic health assessment of every passenger. No passengers (regardless of citizenship) who are showing symptoms of coronavirus will be allowed to board. Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br>
 Air travellers whose final destination is Canada are required to submit their information digitally through Canadaâ€™s ArriveCAN app before they board their flight. From 22 February, this will also apply to travellers arriving by land. This includes travel and contact information, quarantine plan and COVID-19 symptom self-assessment. You must be ready to show your ArriveCAN receipt when seeking entry into Canada, as well as evidence that you have submitted your details digitally. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/arrivecan.html"">Public Health Agency of Canadaâ€™s website</a> and on <a href=""https://tc.canada.ca/en/initiatives/covid-19-measures-updates-guidance-issued-transport-canada/covid-19-information-travellers"">Transport Canadaâ€™s website</a>.<br>
 *Transiting Canada: If youâ€™re planning to transit via Canada to reach the UK, you should be aware that exceptions apply. A person â€˜in transitâ€™ means that they: <br>
 â€¢ arrive and depart from the same airport within a reasonable time frame (the Canadian authorities advise this means as short as possible, and certainly less than 24 hours) <br>
 â€¢ remain on the air side or sterile area of the airport<br>
 â€¢ do not have to go through Customs and formally enter Canada and pick up their bags so they can take their next flight<br>
 â€¢ do not move between terminals at an airport, unless they can do so without going through Customs and formally entering Canada<br>
 â€¢ do not take a domestic flight to get to another airport so they can catch their next international flight<br>
 Canadian authorities require passengers to wear a face covering on flights to and from Canada, and within airport terminals in Canada. Passengers arriving at or departing from Canadian airports must demonstrate that they have the necessary face mask or face covering during the boarding process, otherwise they will be stopped from continuing their journey. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. Further information is available on <a href=""https://tc.canada.ca/en/initiatives/covid-19-measures-updates-guidance-issued-transport-canada/covid-19-information-travellers"">Transport Canadaâ€™s website</a>.<br>
 The Canadian authorities require visitors transiting through Canada to obtain an Electronic Travel Authorisation (eTA) see <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/canada/entry-requirements"">Entry requirements</a>, unless you are otherwise exempted (for example, if you have a valid Canadian visa or a permanent resident card). <br>
 If you have any further questions, you should contact your airline, <a href=""https://www.tc.gc.ca/en/transport-canada/corporate/contact-transport-canada.html"">Transport Canada</a>, or your nearest Canadian high commission, embassy or consulate.
 *Testing / screening on arrival: All air passengers must wear a non-medical mask or face covering during travel, within airport terminals and to their place of self-isolation. People displaying symptoms of coronavirus when they arrive in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.
 In addition to the mandatory pre-departure tests, from 22 February, all travellers arriving in Canada by land and air, with some exceptions, will be required to take an additional test on arrival, and another toward the end of the 14 day self-isolation period. International travellers arriving at Toronto Pearson airport are already required to take an additional COVID-19 test on arrival. Further details are available on the <a href=""https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/60176/ontario-takes-immediate-action-to-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19-variants-1"">Government of Ontarioâ€™s website</a>. <br>
 You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities. For questions about travel during the coronavirus pandemic, check the <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/corporate/contact-us.html"">Health Canada website</a>.<br>
 *Quarantine requirements: Everyone arriving in Canada is legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply. You must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a 2-week period. <br>
 Authorities in Alberta are piloting a voluntary testing scheme for travellers arriving in Canada at Calgary airport or via the Coutts land border crossing from the US, to shorten time spent in self-isolation. Further details are available on the <a href=""https://www.alberta.ca/international-border-pilot-project.aspx"">Government of Albertaâ€™s website</a>. The scheme will be suspended upon introduction of mandatory testing on arrival from 22 February. <br>
 With limited exceptions, air travellers arriving from 22 February will be required to reserve, prior to departure to Canada, a 3 night stay in a government-authorised hotel at their own expense. Travellers will be able to book their government-authorised stay starting 18 February 2021.

The Chilean authorities will reassess this restriction at the end of May. See <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/chile/coronavirus"">Coronavirus</a>. Additionally, since 5 April at 5am, all Chilean borders (including Santiago Airport) are closed and Chilean authorities are currently prohibiting all non-essential overseas travel to Chileans and resident foreign nationals.

All travellers will be transferred to a â€˜transitoryâ€™ hotel, and will have to take a PCR test. They must remain there for five days. After staying at the â€˜transitoryâ€™ hotel for five days and having obtained a negative PCR test result, passengers are allowed to leave the â€˜transitoryâ€™ hotel to continue to their final destination where they will have to complete the remaining five-day of quarantine. If the PCR test result is positive, the passenger will have to remain in a â€˜Residencia Sanitariaâ€™ (quarantine hotel). All costs related to transfer, transitory hotel, quarantine hotel and PCR test may be charged to the passenger prior to boarding the flight to Chile when filling in the <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">â€˜Pasaporte Sanitarioâ€™</a> or on arrival in Chile. <a href=""https://www.nuevopudahuel.cl/covid-19-en?language=en"">Check the Santiago Airport official website</a> (in English) for further information.<br>

Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. There is currently a nationwide curfew between 9pm and 5am, seven days a week. If you have a medical emergency or funeral during curfew times, you must <a href=""http://www.comisariavirtual.cl/"">issue a permit (Salvoconducto) online</a>.
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. <br>
Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after.<br>
On 28 July, local areas (â€œcomunasâ€?) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean governmentâ€™s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: <br>
Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity only from Monday to Friday; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 9am to11am for 60 minutes or between 4pm to 6pm; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 5am to 9am and on weekends and bank holidays between 5am to10am. <br>
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday at any time (except on curfew). On weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. <br>
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. <br>
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafÃ©s allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am (from 5 April), social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75â€™s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br>
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. <br>
The Governmentâ€™s <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">â€˜Paso a Pasoâ€™ website</a> utlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (â€˜SituaciÃ³n Comunalâ€™). In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br>
The government has introduced a special holiday permit (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in â€˜Transitionâ€™ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">official Chilean advice</a>. Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">â€œSalvoconductoâ€? permit </a> and a <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/formularios.html"">â€œHealth Passportâ€?</a> (â€œpasaporte sanitarioâ€?) (under â€œviajeros regionalesâ€? for residents or â€œviajeros regionalesâ€? for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before. <br>
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Governmentâ€™s <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/plandeaccion/"">â€˜Plan de AcciÃ³nâ€™</a>. <br>
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">â€œHealth Passportâ€?</a> prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br>

 <br>
 International Restrictions:<br>
 *Entry and transit:  Entry into China is subject to satisfying visa requirements and the submission of a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate before travel, who will need to certify the form and return it via email. More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found from the nearest Chinese Embassy website.<br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. <br>
On 15 March the Chinese authorities announced a relaxation of certain requirements for visa applicants who can prove inoculation with a vaccine produced in China. Further details should be taken from the nearest Chinese Embassy website. <br>
A limited number of international flights from countries are flying into Beijing. International passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xiâ€™an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
*Health checks on arrival:  All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. <br>
Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact your nearest  Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br>
You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you should call consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. <br>
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br>
For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
â€¢        unless directed by the authorities youâ€™re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means youâ€™re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br>
â€¢        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br>
â€¢        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br>
â€¢        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br>
â€¢        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms.<br>
â€¢        if youâ€™re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.
  <br>
  <br> 
  Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations â€“ such locations are also increasingly needing the use of â€˜health kit codeâ€™ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br>
 Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>
 The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br>
 There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.";20210423;"Quarantine requirement at government designated site.

International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Cuba: From 10 January 2021, everyone travelling to Cuba must have a certified proof of a negative result of a PCR test taken within 72 hours before travel at an accredited testing centre in the UK or the country you are travelling from. Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br>
 *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.

 International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry to Ecuador: All land borders with Colombia and Peru remain closed until further notice. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador, via Rumichaca and Huaquillas northern and southern borders. All ports remain closed. <br>
As of 1 June 2020, international commercial flights have resumed operations to and from Ecuador. However, following the identification of a new variant of Coronavirus, we highly recommend you to contact your airline/travel company to check your travel itinerary. <br>
*Testing / screening on arrival: Upon arrival, all passengers will be required to sign a health declaration form with their itinerary and local contact details. They must also present a negative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) qualitative test for COVID-19, or a negative antigen rapid test, taken up to 3 days prior to their arrival in the country. This is a mandatory requirement, which airlines are responsible for enforcing in order to allow passengers to board.<br>
As of 22 March 2021, travellers who have had their complete COVID-19 vaccination can present the official vaccination certificate instead of the above negative RT-PCR or rapid test result. However, the use of â€œImmunity Certificates or Vaccination Certificates/Cardsâ€? from foreign passengers will be subject to constant review. You should arrange to take a private test.<br>
Passengers who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 through a positive RT-PCR test, if over a month has passed since the beginning of the symptoms, and who continue to show a positive test result, can be exempted from the above general requirement to enter the country (only if they no longer have symptoms, and if they present an official Medical Certificate which certifies their health condition, issued in their country of origin).<br>
Only airline crew members, children under 2 years old and passengers on transit to other countries are exempt from the RT-PCR or Antigen rapid test or the COVID-19 vaccination certificate requirement. <br>
If, on arrival, a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, they will be evaluated by a health care worker and if necessary will be taken to the nearest health centre for a full evaluation. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Passengers who test positive in the antigen test taken at the airport will need to self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation for non-residents can be carried out in any hotel. Local residents and people qualified as â€œpriority attention groupsâ€? such as people over 65 years old, children and pregnant women, will be allowed to self-isolate at their homes. <br>
As of 9 April 2021, passengers arriving from Brazil, including those who had been in transit only, will need to self-isolate for 10 days in any hotel accredited by the Ministry of Tourism, regardless of the results of any test for COVID-19. This new requirement was announced by Ecuadorâ€™s National Emergency Committee on 6 April. <br>
The Ministry of Health has published <a href=""https://coronavirusecuador.com/"">more information on coronavirus protocols</a> that also allows for direct messaging with the Ministry (Spanish only). If you need to find emergency accommodation to go through the mandatory self-isolation protocol, you can access options on the <a href=""https://www.salud.gob.ec/aislamiento-preventivo-obligatorio-apo-documentos-normativos-covid19/"">Ministry of Health website</a><br>

The tour operators or hotels are responsible for arranging this safe passage document on behalf of tourists, given that visitors are required to have previous contracted travel and accommodation arrangements. The Galapagos Transit Control Card, will need to be filled out online at least 24 hours before the flight. On arrival in Ecuador you will be required to fill in a Health Status Declaration, including a local address. Travel health insurance is mandatory for foreign tourists. <br>

 Internal Restrictions: <br>
 *COVID-19 restrictions: Restrictions on social contact aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 are in place in Germany, though gradually being reduced:<br>
â€¢ Private gatherings are restricted to one household plus another household up to a maximum of five people. Children under the age of 14 do not count towards the maximum of five. Tighter restrictions are in place in areas of high infection rates. Looser restrictions are in place where the incidence rate is below 35 in some states<br>
â€¢ The fully vaccinated and those who have recovered are exempt from the above restrictions on contact, as well as limits on contactless sport (these vary in the states). The fully vaccinated can demonstrate their status by using yellow vaccination booklets â€˜Impfpassâ€™ which contain a doctorâ€™s signature and stamp. The recovered must show a positive PCR test no older than six months and no younger than 28 days. Germany is working on a C-19 certification app.<br>
â€¢ Employers are legally obliged to allow employees to work from home, where their work activities allow, with employees required to justify why they cannot work from home.<br>
â€¢ Depending on local incidence rates, there are restrictions on non-essential retail, gastronomy, barbers and hairdressers, museums, art galleries, and other cultural and leisure activities. These establishments might be closed completely, or you might need to register for an appointment in advance, or show C-19 certification, such as a test or vaccination status.<br>
â€¢ Medical grade masks are compulsory in shops and public transport, replacing a previous requirement for simple mouth-nose coverings. This may be an FFP-2 mask, rather than a simple surgical mask. You should follow local guidance. <br>
These restrictions are implemented by Germanyâ€™s 16 states. Where the sevenâ€“day incidence rate exceeds 100, restrictions may be tighter or be re-imposed with limited notice.<br>

International Restrictions:<br>
*Entry to Ghana: Kotoka International Airport is open. Commercial flights are operating to and from Ghana. Check with your travel company for the latest information. Land and sea borders remain closed. COVID-19 protocols at the airport may be subject to change as the new screening process evolves. See the guidance from the <a href=""http://www.gcaa.com.gh/web/?page_id=1172"">Ghana Civil Aviation Authority</a>. <br>
Passengers travelling to Ghana are required to undergo a COVID test 72hrs before departure; complete additional health declaration forms on arrival; and undergo a further COVID test on arrival: <br>
*Coronavirus tests before departure: On 21 April the Government of Ghana introduced the mandatory digitisation of all COVID-19 tests for international air travel, with the implementation of the Trusted Travel scheme. Passengers travelling to Ghana are now required to: <br>
1.        Take a Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test with one of the listed providers within 72 hours of departure. Visit https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ for a certified list of providers. <br>
2.        Create an account at https://trustedtravel.panabios.org/ with the same email address and mobile telephone number you give your PCR test provider. Log on and select check-in; select UK and Ghana as your departure and destination countries; select lab tests (TT); select the matching lab test from the drop down options; click save; provide your flight and passport details as requested; click save to generate a Travel Code (TC); your TC code is then generated for you to copy or download.<br>
3.        If your provider is unable to upload your test certificate on your behalf you should enter your TT or BIOMARS code from your PCR certificate, or upload the certificate yourself.<br>
4.        Whilst the system remains new we also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result, to present on arrival.<br>
Children under the age of 5 are exempt. For passengers who have transited other countries before arriving in Ghana, the first country of departure will be the reference point.<br>
The same arrangements apply to passengers aged 11+ departing from Ghana to the UK, and you may not be allowed to board flights without uploading a certified Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID test.<br> Visit https://africacdc.org/trusted-travel/ for a certified list of providers in Ghana. Whilst the system remains new we also recommend travelling with hard copy proof of this negative Polymerise Chain Reaction (PCR) COVID-19 test result, to present on departure.<br>
If the UK is your final destination, check-in staff will also confirm your UK passenger locator form has been completed and that all passengers aged 5+ have evidence of day 2 and 8 tests booked in UK<br>
*Additional forms and checks upon arrival: On arrival to Ghana, passengers are also required by the Government of Ghana to:<br>
â€¢        Complete an <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">online health declaration form</a>
pre-departure. All passengers may also be asked to complete hard copy self-declaration forms on the flight, confirming they are fit to travel and providing details to facilitate contact tracing.<br>
â€¢        Wear a face-mask throughout their flight and upon landing in Accra.<br>
â€¢        Undergo a temperature check on arrival.<br>
On arrival all passengers will be subject to a mandatory COVID-19 test at Kotoka International airport. The test is an antigen fluorescent immunoassay test and it will be conducted before baggage is collected at a cost of $150 per passenger. Payment should be made <a href=""https://myfrontierhealthcare.com/"">online</a> prior to boarding. Children under the age of five are exempt.<br>
During busy period when there may be a large number of passengers disembarking at the same time the testing area may become busy. Test results are normally ready within one hour, depending how busy the airport is. The pre departure area where test results are collected can also get busy. You can check your results <a href=""https://www.ghs-hdf.org/"">online</a> while you wait. Be prepared for additional time to move through and exit the airport.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: All arriving passengers should be prepared to comply with Ghanaâ€™s COVID-19 Health Protocols. This may, depending on the test result of individuals or others on the flight, involve time in quarantine or in a Government Health facility.

Please note that children under the age of 16 cannot stay at the Rambler Hotel unaccompanied. Parents who stay with their child at the HCTR on the first night whilst awaiting test results, will have to continue to self-isolate for the full 14 days. If travelling unaccompanied, there is a risk that a child may have to stay alone overnight at the airport on arrival while awaiting test results. Further information is available on the <a href=""https://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/holding_centre_en.pdf"">Centre for Health Protectionâ€™s website</a>.<br>

If you are deemed to be a close contact of a positive case, you will be place in a Hong Kong government quarantine centre for 21 days. All arrivals including those who test negative for coronavirus need to undergo 21-day compulsory quarantine in a designated hotel. See â€œQuarantine requirementsâ€? below.<br>
You may be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +(852) 2901 3000 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: Quarantine is mostly spent at a <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/pdf/designated-hotel-list_en.pdf"">designated hotel</a>. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will be placed in a government quarantine centre. Children travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 21 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR governmentâ€™s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html"">Hong Kong SAR governmentâ€™s website</a><br>

The Italian government issued a new legislative decree on 17 May, which modifies the roadmap for reopening activities in Italy. It is in effect from 18 May. <br>
While the majority of the measures of the 22 April legislative decree applicable from 26 April - 31 July 2021 still apply, the following critical changes will apply: <br>
Classification of regions: The criteria for the classification of regions has been redefined such that the primary indicators are now (a) hospitalizations and ICU occupancy rates and (b) number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants<br>
â€¢        Curfew: Gradually, curfew will be lifted throughout the country:<br>
o        From 19 May, curfew starts one hour later and is thus from 23:00-5:00<br>
o        From 7 June, curfew is from 00:00-5:00<br>
o        From 21 June, curfew will be lifted altogether<br>
o        As a reminder, in White Zones, there is no curfew at any point.<br>
â€¢        In Yellow Zones, the following timeline for reopening activities will apply:<br>
o        22 May: Malls, shopping centers, markets, and business parks may open on weekends<br>

o        15 June: Weddings: both indoor and outdoor wedding receptions will be allowed, but guests will need to possess a Certificazione Verde (aka Green Pass). Conferences and trade shows/exhibitions are allowed to take place.<br>
o        1 July: Indoor pools, spas, amusement parks, arcades, betting halls, casinos, and recreational centers may reopen. Indoor sports competitions may admit audiences up to 25% of capacity and in any case, a maximum of 500 spectators<br>
As a reminder, these are the general rules to continue to follow:<br>
â€¢        Measures that are always required:<br>
o        Masks: It is mandatory to have a mask on one's person at all times, to be worn in public both in enclosed areas and outdoors, except in cases where social distancing is continuously guaranteed. Exceptions to this requirement apply for children under the age of 6 and for persons with medical conditions incompatible with the use of a mask. Masks also do not need to be worn when engaging in physical activity or while consuming food or beverages. The use of masks is strongly recommended in one's own residence in the presence of visitors.
o        Social distancing continues to be required; 1 meter interpersonal distance at all times!<br>

â€¢        Certificazione verde or Green Pass:<br>
o        The following persons may be granted a Green Pass:<br> 
â€¢        those who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19<br>
â€¢        those who have fully recovered from COVID-19<br>
â€¢        those who have a negative COVID-19 test (rapid antigen or molecular) from the past 48 hours.<br>
â€¢        Again, infants under the age of 2 are exempt from having to undergo a COVID-19 test and thus do not need a Green Certificate to travel.<br>
o        Green Passes are issued by:<b>
â€¢        the facility that gave you your vaccine<br>
â€¢        the facility where you were hospitalized for COVID-19 or your GP<br>

Different rules apply for travellers who have been in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil in the previous 14 days; travellers on short-term missions; and humanitarian workers, see separate guidance below. <br>
â€¢        On arrival at entry points, staff will check your temperature and you must wash your hands with soap and water. You must show your symptom checking screening form (mobile app) to public health staff. You must also show your flight itinerary.<br>
â€¢        If you display symptoms of coronavirus, public health officials may take you to a government quarantine or medical facility. See Quarantine requirements.<br>
â€¢        Passengers entering Liberia will be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team (unless exempt from testing). Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. You will receive a unique identification number to retrieve your test results online.<br>
â€¢        You must present proof of payment for your PCR test before your sample is collected. Travellers arriving from ECOWAS countries must pay US$50. Travellers from countries outside the ECOWAS region must pay US$75. There are two payment options available. You can pay in advance via the Lib Travel mobile app, or alternatively, you can pay at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) banking window (in US dollars cash or by card) on arrival.<br>
â€¢        To check your PCR test results online, visit the Self Check Portal 2 to 3 days after your sample was collected. You must enter your unique identification number (provided when your sample was collected), and your year of birth.<br>
â€¢        Government of Liberia strongly recommends that all travellers self-isolate for 7 days and self-monitor symptoms via the Lib Travel app for 14 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.<br>
â€¢        If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberiaâ€™s case management guidelines. This means the National Public Health Institute of Liberia (NPHIL) will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis.<br>
For information on testing for travellers departing Liberia, see International Travel.<br>
*Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil: If you have been in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil in the previous 14 days there are additional entry requirements (managed quarantine). You must complete the general traveller processes above (provide negative PCR test result, complete a Health Screening Arrival Form before arrival, provide your travel itinerary and submit a sample for PCR testing on arrival). You must also book your managed quarantine package before arrival in Liberia.<br>
On arrival, all travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil will be taken directly from the airport to a government-approved quarantine facility (â€œPrecautionary Observation Center/POCâ€?). You must pay your quarantine fees before entering the facility. You will be tested 7 days after arrival. If your test is negative you will be released. It may take several days to receive this result, so you could spend up to 10 days in the POC. <br>
If you test positive for COVID-19 while in the POC, you will be transferred from your POC to a government COVID-19 Treatment Unit at Star Base. You will only be released from the treatment unit after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests. This could mean staying for 20 days or more. Liberian POCs and treatment units are basic.<br>
There are two approved POCs: Star Base (government facility), Bushrod Island. Fees are US$1000 for an individual; US$1200 for a couple; $15000 for families of 3 or more. Fees include lodging and 3 meals per day, plus transportation from the airport to Star Base. Payment for Star Base is by US dollars bank transfer to United Bank for Africa (UBA). <br>

Travellers visiting on short missions of up to 5 days: If you are visiting Liberia for up to 5 days on a short mission (e.g. you were invited by government or an international NGO to provide technical assistance), you are exempt from testing on arrival, if you meet the following requirements (and have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil):<br>
â€¢        The organisation that has invited you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your visit, of the purpose of your visit, the number of travellers, duration of visit, activity to be conducted, exact location you will stay, contact details while in Liberia, and address and contacts of references in Liberia.<br>
â€¢        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia); <br>
â€¢        You must present evidence of short stay (i.e. flight ticket); you must provide details of stay including telephone number, contact person and address; you must observe preventative measures while in Liberia; <br>
â€¢        You should provide your invitation documents. <br>
â€¢        You must present a negative test result on departure if your airline requires this (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers). <br>
â€¢        If your mission is likely to be extended, your organisation must inform the IMS chair or co-chair 24-48 hours in advance. <br>
â€¢        If your stay in Liberia is extended beyond 5 days, you must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers). <br>
*Humanitarian workers deploying to Liberia: If you have travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil you must follow the rules above for managed quarantine. <br>
If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of less than 15 days you should contact your organisation for advice on which rules to follow. If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process: <br>
â€¢        The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia. <br>
â€¢        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). <br>
â€¢        You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. You must remain in your hotel or place of lodging and inform your employer if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19. <br>
â€¢        At the end of your 7-day self-isolation period, you must be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations. <br>
â€¢        If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberiaâ€™s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. <br>
Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival: <br>
â€¢        Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airlineâ€™s requirements. <br>
â€¢        Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airlineâ€™s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers) <br>
â€¢        Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisationsâ€™ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival. <br>
You should arrange to take a private test. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil must stay in an approved quarantine facility for a minimum of 8 days (see Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil above). <br>
For other travellers, depending on the length and reason for your visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for foreign nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. <br>
You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. <br>
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine. <br>

  <br>
  <br>
  International Restrictions: <br>
 *Entry to Myanmar: The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 28 February 2021 at the earliest. It will then review the situation. Residents of the UK, or those who have visited the UK within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate. If you are on a flight transiting via the UK, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the nearest Myanmar Embassy. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>
 *Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
 *Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: 
 â€¢ complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employerâ€™s or doctorâ€™s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test;
 â€¢ provide evidence of a negative COVID test result;
 â€¢ complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival);
 â€¢ undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.
 These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.
 If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
 *Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.
  <br>
  <br>
Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Travel in Myanmar: A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. Prior to recent events, those taking a domestic flight inside Myanmar needed to take a COVID-19 test no more than 36 hours prior to departure. You may still be required to quarantine on arrival at your destination, particularly if you are coming from an area under a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.<br>
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures. The majority of townships in Yangon are currently under a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order. Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order. The rules for Yangon townships under a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in â€˜essential private servicesâ€™ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 8pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar.<br>
Other parts of Myanmar are also under â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you are unsure whether an area is subject to a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a â€˜Stay at Homeâ€™ order may need to contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel.<br>
This guidance from the government of Myanmar is subject to change, and you should check the information issued by the <a href=""https://www.mofa.gov.mm/"">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> on their website and on their <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mofamyanmar/"">Facebook page</a> before you travel inside Myanmar. Further information is also available on the Facebook page for the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfHealthAndSportsMyanmar"">Ministry of Health and Sports</a>  and at their <a href=""https://www.mohs.gov.mm/Home"">website</a>. If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy.<br>
Since 13 May 2020 it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders. It is recommended that foreigners carry: <br>
â€¢        passport<br>
â€¢        Form C (immigration document) <br>
â€¢        Foreignerâ€™s Registration Certificate<br>
â€¢        Myanmar Driverâ€™s Licence (if you own a car) <br>
â€¢        a copy of your passport information page<br>
â€¢        a copy of your Myanmar visa<br>
â€¢        a copy of your immigration stamp showing when you last entered Myanmar. <br>
*Accommodation: There have been reports that some local authorities are carrying out checks to make sure all foreign visitors are staying in registered hotels and guest houses, not in private apartments. This is a requirement under Myanmar law and is a condition of your visa. Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.<br>
*Public places and services: Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place. Some shopping centres may need customers to register their details upon entry. You must wear a face mask in all public places, and a face shield might be required in some locations.The government of Myanmar ordered all schools, including private ones, to close from 26 August.

*Quarantine requirements:  Anyone entering New Zealand (except from within a quarantine-free travel bubble, currently arranged with Australia and the Cook Islands) needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community. From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility. Please see the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details.

You can apply for your MIQ voucher in advance. Space in managed isolation is limited and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=""https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/"">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

Facemasks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland until 15 May, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctorâ€™s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. <br>
You must also wear a facemask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br>
Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members.

All non-essential shops in shopping malls and retail parks including large DIY, homeware and furniture shops are open from 4 May. Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br>
Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open. Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service.

The only exception are individuals travelling from Ascension who have been resident for 14 days or more prior to travel. <br>
There are no other entry restrictions in force and foreign nationals are permitted to enter St Helena provided they meet the immigration rules. <br>
All travellers to Ascension Island require an entry permit visa unless exempted by their occupation, such as active members of UK Armed Forces. Failure to enter with a valid visa is an offence under the Entry Control (Ascension) Ordinance and may result in a fine and imprisonment. Individuals may also be refused permission to land and be required to leave on the aircraft or vessel that they arrived on. Applicants should be aware that their applications may be affected by a change in the Ascension COVID-19 Response Level, particularly if this reflects an escalation of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat on the island. During such circumstances permissions for certain types of entry permits may not be granted, and extant permissions may be revoked. <br>
All arrivals to Ascension that have travelled from a COVID-19 infected area within the last 14 days, or travelled with others who have been in an infected area in the last 14 days, are subject to isolation restrictions for 14 days following their arrival at Ascension unless otherwise directed by the Senior Medical Officer. During this time their conditions are monitored for the development of symptoms which may be considered consistent with COVID-19.

Internal Restrictions: <br>
*Public spaces and services: The Slovak government has imposed restrictions on public life to counter the spread of COVID-19. The measures and restrictions in a given district may change according to the local epidemiological situation, as set out in a framework announced by the Slovak government known as the â€˜Covid Automatâ€™. Details can be found on the <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/koronavirus-na-slovensku-v-cislach/"">Slovak government website</a> (in Slovak only). <br>
The Slovak government has published details (in Slovak only) of a further <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/zakaz-vychadzania-maj/"">easing of local restrictions</a> in certain districts in effect from 3 May. You can also check the local restrictions in each district by typing its name into the Slovak governmentâ€™s <a href=""https://automat.gov.sk/"">online search tool</a>. You can find a summary of the current restrictions in English on the website of the local English-language media, the <a href=""https://spectator.sme.sk/c/22646282/slovakia-is-gradually-opening-up-what-covid-measures-are-in-place.html?ref=njctse"">Slovak Spectator</a>.<br>
From 3 May, the nationwide curfew has been reduced to a period lasting between 9pm until 1am the following morning. During this period, you may only leave home for certain essential purposes including travel to work, to hospital or a pharmacy, or to walk a pet. You may need to show a recent negative COVID-19 test when travelling to work during this period. A daytime curfew remains in place between 5am and 9pm in the districts with the highest infection rates. These districts are marked as â€˜dark redâ€™ or â€˜Tier IIIâ€™ in the colour-coded Covid Automat.<br>
The Slovak government has permitted the reopening of shops and some services, swimming pools, fitness centres, libraries and museums. Hotels may accommodate people from one household or a maximum of two adults per room, but guests need a negative PCR or antigen test no older than 72 hours. Hotel indoor restaurants will remain closed. Outdoor dining areas have reopened, with social distancing and hygiene measures in place. It is now possible to visit friends and family in other households in districts marked in the Covid Automat as â€˜redâ€™ or lower. Some cultural events for more than 6 people are also permitted, with strict hygiene and social distancing measures in place.<br>
You must still wear a facemask of FFP2 standard, or higher, inside all buildings and on public transport, but regular facemasks are acceptable in schools and outdoors. Facemasks are not obligatory outdoors if people can maintain five metres distance or they live together in one household. You must wear a facemask at an outdoor dining area, unless you are eating and drinking.<br>
From 3 May, you no longer need to show a negative COVID-19 test result between 5am and 9pm in districts marked in the Covid Automat as â€˜redâ€™ or lower (except for attending events of over 6 people, or going to a hotel or ski resort).<br>
Travelling abroad for holidays is currently prohibited, and breaches of the rule could incur a fine of up to 1000 euros. You should expect extra checks and possible delays at borders and airports when leaving Slovakia, and you may be asked to show documentary evidence that your journey is essential.<br>

Taiwanese government bars entry of foreign travelers who have recently been to India (Reuters, 03.05.2021).
 <br>
 <br>
 International Restrictions: <br>
*Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19): -Travel ban on foreign nationals: The authorities have announced a temporary ban on foreign nationals entering, or transiting, Taiwan, with the exception of residents. These measures will be effective from 19 May until 18 June and will be adjusted on a rolling basis depending on the latest COVID-19 situation. Exceptions may be made for emergency or humanitarian reasons. Anyone entering Taiwan will be required to follow the quarantine requirements set out below. You should refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further information regarding entry and quarantine requirements in Taiwan. A link to the CDCâ€™s FAQ page can be found on the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Category/QAPage/SbkmnM5v0OwdDMjJ2tI_xw"">CDC website</a>. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: The local authorities have announced that from 15 January 2021, there will be tightened quarantine measures in Taiwan, and group quarantine facilities will now be available for passengers travelling from low-risk countries. Passengers who are eligible and choose to quarantine at a private residence rather than a quarantine hotel or a group quarantine facility will be required to declare that their residence complies with quarantine requirements. You should refer to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En"">Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for further information</a>. <br>
*Screening on arrival: All passengers arriving or transiting in Taiwan are required to present a certificate of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR test in order to be able to board their flight to Taiwan. Any exemption due to exceptional circumstances will require prior approval before departure. This test needs to have taken place within three working days before the date of departure. Test Certificates of a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR must be issued by a recognised medical institution in the country of departure and include the following information: <br>
â€¢        the passengerâ€™s full name as per their passport, <br
â€¢        the date of birth or passport number of the traveller, <br>
â€¢        specimen collection date and test report date, <br>
â€¢        the virus name, testing method and the test result. <br>
Test Certificates are required to be produced in either English or Chinese; however, in situations where the passenger provides a certificate in either French or Spanish, if the certificate is in the official language of the place of departure, and ground personnel of the airline are able to assist with the inspection of the content, the certificate may be accepted. <br>
Anyone found to provide false or incorrect test results, or evade or obstruct the quarantine measures, may face a fine of between NT$10,000 to NT$150,000 and further criminal charges. <br>
Refer to the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control for further information regarding Test Exemptions, Test Certificates and COVID-19 test requirements. <br>
*Transiting Taiwan: Taiwan announced on 17 May that foreign nationals will not be able to transit Taiwan from 00:01 on 19 May until 18 June. Rules and procedures may change at short notice. For further information, you should contact your airline or provider.

*Travelling to and from the airport: On arrival in Taiwan, you will be required to take an allocated taxi to your designated quarantine destination. For more information about self-isolation see Entry requirements. Taxis and public transport systems are operating normally in Taiwan. The wearing of face masks is mandatory on all public transport.

COVID-19 restrictions eased in Kyiv (Reuters, 01.05.2021). Ukrainian government imposes entry ban on foreign nationals arriving from India beginning 2 May (Reuters, 30.04.2021)
  <br>
  <br>
International Restrictions: <br>
Entry and borders: Upon arrival, all non-exempt foreign nationals are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
From 24 March 2021, all non-exempt foreign nationals must also provide proof of a negative PCR test, taken no more than 72 hours in advance of their arrival in Ukraine. This does not apply to children under 12 years of age. Though the Ukrainian government is yet to set out the full details, presenting this test should also mean that foreign nationals do not need to self-isolate on arrival and do not need to download the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Diia Vdoma app</a>.  <br>
According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 22 March 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance and PCR testing requirements: foreign nationals who are: residents of Ukraine; recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomatsâ€™ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or â€œPartnership for Peaceâ€? countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br>
From 2 May 2021, Ukraine is restricting entry from India. Foreign nationals will not be permitted to enter Ukraine if they arrive from India or have spent more than 7 of the preceding 14 days in India. There are exemptions for permanent residents of Ukraine, spouses or children of Ukrainian citizens, and diplomats and their families. See the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/"">VisitUkraine website</a> and type India into the list of countries box for more details.<br>
The final decision on a personâ€™s eligibility to enter Ukraine rests with the Ukrainian State Border Service. The entry requirement policies of foreign governments are imposed and enforced at their discretion. <br>
*Transiting Ukraine: Foreign nationals transiting Ukraine are required to provide proof of health insurance that covers COVID-19 observation and treatment for the duration of their stay. Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Foreign nationals with a valid negative PCR test should not have to self-isolate on arrival in Ukraine, although this has not been made explicit in the government of Ukraineâ€™s announcements so far. This page will be updated with further details as they become available. It is not possible to self-isolate as an alternative to the requirement to take a PCR test before arrival. <br>
Ukrainian citizens (including those with dual nationality) and foreign residents of Ukraine must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, unless they take a PCR test and receive a negative result no more than 48 (not 72) hours before arrival in Ukraine. Residents or Ukrainian nationals arriving in Ukraine without a negative PCR test must install the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Dii Vdoma tracking app</a> for their 14-day self-isolation. The 14 day self-isolation can be terminated early by taking a PCR test and receiving a negative result. <br>
Self-isolation on entry to Ukraine can be completed at your chosen address using the <a href="""">â€œDii Vdomaâ€? mobile app</a>. You need to have a Ukrainian mobile phone number with the SIM card activated before you arrive in the country, though the SIM does not need to be in your phone on arrival. When using the app, you must respond promptly to notifications sent to your mobile (in Ukrainian). <br>
More information about the app is available on the <a href="""">Cabinet of Ministers website</a> or the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Visit Ukraine webpage</a>. Make sure that you understand the regular reporting requirements before taking up this option. People who do not register with the <a href=""https://visitukraine.today/#diya"">Dii Vdoma app</a>, or who do not abide by its terms, are required to complete quarantine at a government-approved observation centre. <br>
Travellers arriving in Ukraine or crossing the administrative points from non-government-controlled parts of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and Crimea will be subject to health monitoring on arrival. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the authorities.
